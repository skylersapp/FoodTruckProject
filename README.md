## Overview

* Users will input and rate a list of food trucks, then view the average rating and the highest-rated truck

## Structure

* I will define a FoodTruck class with fields for a unique numeric id, a name ("TacoRific", "Mediterranean Medic", etc.), food type ("Tacos", "Falafel", etc.), and a numeric rating.

* I will create a separate class with a main method that starts the program. It will have an array to store up to five FoodTruck objects. The main method of this class is the only static method in the entire project.

## Completion Criteria

	• There are no static methods other than the one main method.
	
	• When a FoodTruck is created, its constructor assigns its id field the current value of a static field (such as (nextTruckId) and then increments the static field.
	
	• The user can input up to five food trucks.
	
	• The user can stop inputing trucks before entering five by entering quit as the truck name, after which all input stops and the program continues.
	
	• When a menu item is chosen the list of all trucks entered is displayed. If less than five were input, only those trucks that were created are displayed.
	
	• When another menu item is chosen the average rating based on the number of trucks entered is displayed.
	
	• When another menu item is chosen the winning truck - the one that was input with the highest rating - is displayed with all its properties.
	
	• Food trucks are displayed by printing its toString, which includes all FoodTruck fields.
	
	• When the quit menu item is chosen, the program ends with a message.

## Challenges

I felt "behind" the entire week leading up to this project, so getting through it really took me a significantly larger amount of 
studying and re-learning than I would have liked. I also had to fight with my loops in order to get the exact output I was looking for. 

## Lessons Learned

Code definitely looks cleaner and is far more scalable when using multiple classes and methods. Object creation was a sticking point for me coming into this project, but I feel like I've really improved my knowledge of the concept. I still have room for improvement, but I feel like that will honestly be the case with the majority of Java throughout my career.
